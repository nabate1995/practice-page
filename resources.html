                        <h3>Belzenlok, the War of the Abyss</h3>
                        
                        <p>Belzenlok fought in something called "The War of the Abyss", and had been stuck in the Abyss ever since.<br>
                            The Cabal of Dominaria, desperate for leadership after the demise of The First, performed a ritual to summon Kuberr, but accidentally freed Belzenlok from the Abyss.<br>
                            As part of the Cabal, the Demonlord began the process of rewriting history with himself as the lead.<br>
                            Claiming Yawgmoth's title of Lord of the Wastes and Dakkon Blackblade's accomplishments of forging the Blackblade and killing the Elder Dragon Piru.<br>
                            He was also known as the Evincar of the Stronghold, King of Urborg, Scion of Darkness, Doom of Fools, Master of the Ebon Hand, and the Eternal Patriarch of the Cabal.<br>
                            After subjugating much of Dominaria beneath his rule, he was ultimately killed in a strike against the Cabal Stronghold by the skyship Weatherlight and its crew.<br>
                            The Planeswalker Gideon Jura infiltrated the Stronghold and seized control of the Blackblade, and in the ensuing battle.<br>
                            Liliana Vess used the legendary sword to slay Belzenlok and end his reign.</p>

                                <p>Urami disliked the uncorporeal food provided by the Kakuriyo.<br>
                                    He turned his wathering mouth to the corporeal realm of Kamigawa.<br>
                                    In order to create a constant supply of tangible food, Urami struck a deal with a group of ogre-magi.</p>
