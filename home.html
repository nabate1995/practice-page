                        <h3>The History of Rakdos</h3>
                        
                        <p>Rakdos is the demonic parun and guildmaster of the Cult of Rakdos on Ravnica.<br>
                        He spends most of his time slumbering in a lava pit located in Rix Maadi.<br>He was given responsibility of a guild by the guildpact in an effort to bind him to a greater purpose,<br>
                         or at the very least keep him busy enough that he would be less of a problem for the other guildmasters.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="articles"></div>
                    <p>Rakdos embodies hedonism. He is also a consummate entertainer, whose mere appearance is an act of grisly performance art.<br>
                       A monstrous figure standing thirty feet tall, spreading enormous wings, crowned with fire and swinging a flaming scythe, Rakdos demands the spotlight. <br>
                       His every entrance is a Showstopper. Rakdos' armour resembles the signet of the Rakdos guild.<br>
                       Sometimes after his grand entrance, Rakdos crouches to witness the performances of those who adore him.<br>
                       To them, his opinion is only one that matters, but he is a demanding spectator.<br>
                       He has seen thousands of years of circus tricks and has no patience for performers who don't give their all.<br>
                       His flaming sword has brought more than one tepid show to a sudden and spectacular close.</p>
