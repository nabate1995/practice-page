                        <h3>The History of the Cult</h3>
                        
                        <p>At the time of the Decamillennial Celebration, the acting guildmaster, human bloodwitch Izolda.<br>
                            Procured spinal fluid from a dragon, blood from Jarad, and blood from Jarad's son Myc to rouse Rakdos from his sleep.<br>
                            Rakdos awakened and wreaked havoc in the streets of Ravnica until the demon crossed the path of Project Kraj.k<br>
                            After Project Kraj absorbed Rakdos into its body, sustaining injuries, the comatose Rakdos was thrown back into his lava pit, Rix Maadi, by the Boros Angel Feather, uncertain of his return.<br>
                            Sensing her weakness after the defeat of their demonic guildmaster, Izolda's followers summarily devoured her alive.</p>
                    
                        <p> Rakdos, an ancient demon, the Cult of Rakdos attend to menial labor and the services industry, which includes some less-than-savory offerings.<br>
                            Such as assassination, as well as more agreeable ones, such as the catering (i.e., food service) and entertainment industries.<br>
                            Members of the demon-worshipping guild are referred to as cultists. <br>
                            Like extreme utilitarians or hedonists, the Cult of Rakdos are a guild that places a premium on personal pleasure, or "fun", even if it cruelly causes pain and suffering to others and themselves.<br>
                            Some of the crueler, more evil, and more sadistic members of the Cult directly and intentionally inflict pain on others.<br>
                            Other than being a guild of miscreants, the Cult of Rakdos does have a civic function in Ravnican society per the Guildpact; some members work as manual laborers and even slaves.<br>
                            The Guild overall has a niche as Ravnica's entertainment industry, such as clubs.<br>
                            Rakdos is the undisputed center of attention of the Cult when he is awake;<br>
                            when the demon is hibernating, however, there is an acting guildmaster.<br>
                            At the time of the Decamillennial, the acting guildmaster was the human sorceress Izolda (or Lyzolda).</p>
